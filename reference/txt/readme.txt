* When in doubt, reboot!  If you must, remove power entirely for a couple seconds.  This fixes a lot of issues and will definitely exit anything you happen to be stuck in.

* To power off a PS3 or PS4 controller in wireless mode, hold the PS button until the light turns off.  Should happen in 10-15 seconds.

=====PS3 CONTROLLERS:
* To PAIR a PS3 controller to the Primestation:
    1. With the Primestation powered on,
    2. Connect the PS3 controller to the Primestation's USB port.  
    3. Press the PS button to enable controller.
    4. Wait 5 seconds.
    5. Disconnect PS3 controller from USB.
    6. Press PS button to attempt connection
    7. Should only need step 6 from now on, unless you connect this PS3 controller elsewhere, like to a real PS3)

* NOTE: Some generic PS3 controllers will simply not work anywhere but a real PS3.


====PS4 CONTROLLERS:
* To PAIR a PS4 controller to the Primestation:
    1. With the Primestation powered on,
    2. Connect the PS4 controller to the Primestation's USB port.  
    3. Press the PS button to enable controller.
    4. Wait 5nds.
    5. Disconnect PS4 controller from USB.
    6. Press and hold the SHARE button, then also press and hold the PS button until the light blinks quickly.  This should take about 5.  
    7. The Primestation should notice the controller is in pairing mode and attempt to connect to it automatically within 5 - 10 seconds.
    8. In the future, for genuine Sony PS4 controllers, you can skip steps 1 - 7 and simply press PS button to attempt connection
    9. (unless you connect this PS4 controller elsewhere, like to a real PS4)
    10. Please note that generic PS4 controllers will probably require steps 1 - 7 every time you want to connect to the Primestation.

* NOTE: Some generic PS4 controllers are simply not as good as genuine Sony brand.  You may experience latency or connection difficulties when not connected a real PS4.
 -- Suggestion: Use generic PS4 controllers on a real PS4, use your genuine controllers on the Primestation for the best experience.
