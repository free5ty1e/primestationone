* Most generic "ShanWan" as well as "Gasia" PS3 controllers are now supported via Bluetooth, and of course coexist with genuine Sony controllers.  Most will even rumble and show the LED animation during connection.  All the controllers pictured here can now be utilized with the Primestation:

* Experimental FFMPEG-based RetroArch emulator recording is now possible; an experimental NESTOPIA menu entry has been added to emulate and record MPG videos of you playing games, although you will probably have to disable rewind in order to play the game at a reasonable framerate while this is occurring.  The video produced looks something like this, so far no audio configured:

* Later model / 2015+ Generic "ShanWan" PS3 controllers now supported via Bluetooth
* Swapped SELECT and PS3 buttons; now hold the PS3 button to enable the other hotkeys instead of SELECT.  This enables SELECT as a usable button in games again, and enables many nice things (like screenshotting without having to emulator-pause to avoid advancing the game with SELECT, as in FF2)
