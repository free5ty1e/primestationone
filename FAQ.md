# PrimeStation One FAQ:

* Q: Why are there so many emulators?  Why do some have icons and some have text labels?
* A: Each system (such as Super Nintendo / SNES) has a recommended emulator that tends to work the best on most games.  You may find that some games, such as Final Fantasy 3, have inaccurate sound on the recommended emulator, so you can try it out on the other SNES emulators (FF3 plays best with the *Snes9xNext-Pi2 emulator, for example)

* Q: How do I pair my Genuine Sony Playstation 3 Controller (sixaxis or dualshock3) to the PrimeStation wirelessly?  I have a compatible Bluetooth USB adapter (any generic CSR 4.0 based adapter from Amazon Prime).
* A: Simply connect it via your standard USB Mini cable to a powered PrimeStation, press the center PS button, wait for ~5 seconds or so, then remove the cable.  If your controller doesn't pair within 5-10 seconds, try connecting USB again while the lights are flashing, then wait ~5 seconds, and remove USB again.  It should be paired at this point, until you connect USB to a real PS3 or a different PrimeStation that tells it to connect elsewhere (then you must repeat this process).

* Q: Help, my PrimeStation crashed or is not responding!
* A: OK, that's not a question.

* Q: ....what can I do if the PrimeStation crashes or stops responding?
* A: That's better.  If you have the PrimeStation One Convenience / Control App for Android installed (see QR code below or search "primestation" on the Play Store), you can force a graceful reset, shutdown, or even kill all emulators and restart the EmulationStation menu system.  
* ...If none of these controls work, you might actually have to physically remove and replace power.  The PrimeStation should recover quite handily from even the nastiest crashes after a reboot or two...
